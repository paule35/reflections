What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden directory called '.git' which will contain the config for the git project, which allows you to start committing changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as a middle-ground between the working directory and the repository. Files that are changed are added to the staging area, before being commited to the repository. 
The value it offers is that it makes adding small incremental changes easier. These changes can be bundled up in one staging area, before being all committed to the repository.
