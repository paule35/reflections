When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you were working in teams, where several people may want to push changes to the repository. When you are working on more that one PC.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there may be changes made to the remote respository that conflict with your own changes.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used on GitHub to duplicate a repository. This is useful for when you don't have permission to change a project, but want to make changes.
Cloning is where you duplicate the repository onto your local computer from GitHub or from another part of the computer. It is useful when you want to start working on a project on your computer.
Branching is where you have code which is not part of the main master branch. This is useful when you want to experiemnt or work on a feature.
